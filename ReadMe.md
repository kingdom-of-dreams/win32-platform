# Win32Platform

Hyperdrive's adapter targeting Windows OS.

## What is this ?

This project is an implementation of the platform specification for [the Hyperdrive engine](https://github.com/kingdom-of-dreams/hyperdrive). By itself this project doesn't do anything, and it should only be used with the engine.

## How to build it

Because this project is specific to Windows API, we only support VisualStudio and msbuild as a dev env.

If you want a full detail you can check the [.github](./.github) folder for a list of continuous integration actions, we cover in them all the platform we support and their build process.
